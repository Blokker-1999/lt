	<section><title>DNS cache</title>
		<para>DNS is a caching protocol.</para>
		<para>When a client queries its local DNS server, and the local DNS server is not authoritative for the query, then this server will go looking for an authoritative name server in the DNS tree. The local name server will first query a root server, then a <command>tld</command> server and then a domain server. When the local name server resolves the query, then it will relay this information to the client that submitted the query, and it will also keep a copy of these queries in its cache. So when a(nother) client submits the same query to this name server, then it will retrieve this information form its cache.</para>
		<para>For example, a client queries for the A record on www.linux-training.be to its local server. This is the first query ever received by this local server. The local server checks that it is not authoritative for the linux-training.be domain, nor for the <command>.be tld</command>, and it is also not a root server. So the local server will use the root hints to send an <command>iterative</command> query to a root server.</para>
		<para>The root server will reply with a reference to the server that is authoritative for the .be domain (root DNS servers do not resolve fqdn's, and root servers do not respond to recursive queries).</para>
		<para>The local server will then sent an iterative query to the authoritative server for the <command>.be tld</command>. This server will respond with a reference to the name server that is authoritative for the linux-training.be domain.</para>
		<para>The local server will then sent the query for www.linux-training.be to the authoritative server (or one of its slave servers) for the linux-training.be domain. When the local server receives the ip-address for www.linux-training.be, then it will provide this information to the client that submitted this query.</para>
