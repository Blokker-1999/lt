	<para>1. Display <command>A B  C</command> with two spaces between B and C.</para>
	<screen>echo "A B  C"</screen>
	<para>2. Complete the following command (do not use spaces) to display exactly the following output:</para>
	<screen>4+4     =8
10+14   =24</screen>
	<para>The solution is to use tabs with \t.</para>
	<screen>echo -e "4+4\t=8" ; echo -e "10+14\t=24"</screen>
	<para>3. Use echo to display the following exactly:</para>
	<screen>echo '??\\'</screen>
	<para>4. Use one echo command to display three words on three lines.</para>
	<screen>echo -e "one \ntwo \nthree"</screen>
	<para>5. Execute <command>cd /var</command> and <command>ls</command> in an embedded shell.</para>
	<screen>echo $(cd /var ; ls)</screen>
	<para>The <command>echo</command> command is only needed to show the result of the <command>ls</command> command. Omitting will result in the shell trying to execute the first file as a command.</para>
	<para>6. Create the variable embvar in an embedded shell and echo it. Does the variable exist in your current shell now ?</para>
	<screen>$(embvar=emb;echo $embvar) ; echo $embvar (the last echo fails).</screen>
	<screen>$embvar does not exist in your current shell</screen>
	<para>7. Explain what "set -x" does. Can this be useful ?</para>
	<screen>It displays shell expansion for troubleshooting your command.</screen>
	<para>8. Given the following screenshot, add exactly four characters to that command line so that the total output is FirstMiddleLast.</para>
	<screen>
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo  First; echo  Middle; echo  Last
First
Middle
Last</screen>
	<screen>echo -n First; echo -n Middle; echo Last</screen>
	<para>9. Display a <command>long listing</command> (ls -l) of the <command>passwd</command> command using the <command>which</command> command inside back ticks.</para>
	<screen>ls -l `which passwd`</screen>
