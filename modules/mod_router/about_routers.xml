<section><title>router or firewall</title>
	<para>A router is a device that connects two networks. A <command>firewall</command><indexterm><primary>firewall</primary></indexterm> is a device that besides acting as a <command>router</command>, also contains (and implements) rules to determine whether packets are allowed to travel from one network to another. A firewall can be configured to block access based on networks, hosts, protocols and ports. Firewalls can also change the contents of packets while forwarding them.</para>
</section>
<section><title>packet forwarding</title>
	<para>Packet forwarding means allowing packets to go from one network to another. When a multihomed host is connected to two different networks, and it allows packets to travel from one network to another through its two network interfaces, it is said to have enabled <command>packet forwarding</command><indexterm><primary>packet forwarding</primary></indexterm>. </para>
</section>
<section><title>packet filtering</title>
	<para><command>Packet filtering</command><indexterm><primary>packet filtering</primary></indexterm> is very similar to packet forwarding, but every packet is individually tested against rules that decide on allowing or dropping the packet. The rules are stored by iptables.</para>
</section>
<section><title>stateful</title>
	<para>A <command>stateful</command><indexterm><primary>stateful firewall</primary></indexterm> firewall is an advancement over stateless firewalls that inspect every individual packet. A stateful firewall will keep a table of active connections, and is knowledgeable enough to recognise when new connections are part of an active session. Linux iptables is a stateful firewall.</para>

<section><title>NAT (network address translation)</title>
	<para>A <command>NAT</command><indexterm><primary>NAT</primary></indexterm> device is a router that is also changing the source and/or target ip-address in packets. It is typically used to connect multiple computers in a private address range (rfc 1918) with the (public) internet. A NAT can hide private addresses from the internet.</para>
	<para>It is important to understand that people and vendors do not always use the right term when referring to a certain type of NAT. Be sure you talk about the same thing. We can distuinguish several types of NAT.</para>
	<section><title>PAT (port address translation)</title>
		<para>NAT often includes PAT. A <command>PAT</command><indexterm><primary>PAT</primary></indexterm> device is a router that is also changing the source and/or target tcp/udp port in packets. PAT is Cisco terminology and is used by <command>SNAT</command>, <command>DNAT</command>, <command>masquerading</command> and <command>port forwarding</command> in Linux. RFC 3022 calls it <command>NAPT</command><indexterm><primary>NAPT</primary></indexterm> and defines the NAT/PAT combo as "traditional NAT". A device sold to you as a NAT-device will probably do NAT and PAT.</para>

	<section><title>SNAT (source network address translation)</title>
		<para>A <command>SNAT</command><indexterm><primary>SNAT</primary></indexterm> device is changing the source ip-address when a packet passes our NAT. SNAT configuration with iptables includes a fixed target source address.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>masquerading</title>
		<para>Masquerading is a form of SNAT that will hide the (private) source ip-addresses of your private network using a public ip-address. Masquerading is common on dynamic internet interfaces (broadband modem/routers). Masquerade configuration with iptables uses a dynamic target source address.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>DNAT (destination network address translation)</title>
		<para>A <command>DNAT</command><indexterm><primary>DNAT</primary></indexterm> device is changing the destination ip-address when a packet passes our NAT.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>port forwarding</title>
		<para>When static DNAT is set up in a way that allows outside connections to enter our private network, then we call it <command>port forwarding</command><indexterm><primary>port forwarding</primary></indexterm>.</para>
