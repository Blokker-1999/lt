<section><title>Downloading software</title>
	<para>First and most important, whenever you download software, start by reading the README file!</para>
	<para>Normally the readme will explain what to do after download. You will probably receive a .tar.gz or a .tgz file. Read the documentation, then put the compressed file in a directory. You can use the following to find out where the package wants to install.</para>
	<screen>tar tvzpf $downloadedFile.tgz</screen>
	<para>You unpack them like with <command>tar xzf</command><indexterm><primary>tar(1)</primary></indexterm>, it will create a directory called applicationName-1.2.3</para>
	<screen>tar xzf $applicationName.tgz</screen>
	<para>Replace the z with a j when the file ends in .tar.bz2. The <command>tar</command>, <command>gzip</command> and <command>bzip2</command> commands are explained in detail later.</para>
	<para>If you download a .deb file, then you'll have to use dpkg to install it, .rpm's can be installed with the rpm command. Sometimes people use the <command>alien</command><indexterm><primary>alien(1)</primary></indexterm> command to convert between package formats.</para>
