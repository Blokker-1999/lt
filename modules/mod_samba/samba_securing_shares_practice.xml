<section><title>Practice: securing shares</title>
	<para>4. Limit access to the sales share to Sandra, Ann and Veronique. Make sure that Roberto cannot access the share.</para>
	<para>5. Even though the share is writable, Ann should only have read access.</para>
	<para>6. Set the create mask for files to read and write for everyone, test that it works.</para>
	<para>7. Limit one shared directory to the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, and another share to the two computers with ip-addresses 192.168.1.33 and 172.17.18.19.</para>
	<para>8. Make sure users can only see files and directories that they can read. Test that it works!!</para>
	<para>9. If time permits (or if you are waiting for other students to finish this practice), then combine the "read only" and "writable" statements to check which one has priority. Then combine them with "read list", "write list", "hosts allow" and "hosts deny". Then combine them with file permissions on the linux filesystem (chmod,chown) and make a table of minimal mandatory settings for readonly/readwrite shared directories.</para>
