<section><title>How an Operating System works</title>
	<para>The tasks of an operating system include management of <command>hardware</command><indexterm><primary>hardware</primary></indexterm>, <command>memory</command><indexterm><primary>memory</primary></indexterm>, <command>processes</command><indexterm><primary>processes</primary></indexterm> and <command>applications</command><indexterm><primary>applications</primary></indexterm>. An operating system consists of a software <command>kernel</command><indexterm><primary>kernel</primary></indexterm> and a number of tools, and can be considered a <command>platform</command><indexterm><primary>platform</primary></indexterm> for applications.</para>
	<para>To manage the <command>hardware</command><indexterm><primary>hardware</primary></indexterm>, the operating system uses <command>interrupts</command><indexterm><primary>interrupts</primary></indexterm> and <command>device drivers</command><indexterm><primary>device drivers</primary></indexterm>. A monolithic kernel like Linux can dynamically load these in memory as <command>modules</command><indexterm><primary>modules</primary></indexterm>.</para>
	<para>A computer's <command>memory</command><indexterm><primary>memory</primary></indexterm> comes in different speeds and prices, the faster, the more expensive. Ordered from fastest to slowest we have: <command>registers</command><indexterm><primary>registers</primary></indexterm> inside the CPU, <command>cache</command><indexterm><primary>cache</primary></indexterm> on the CPU, <command>RAM modules</command><indexterm><primary>RAM modules</primary></indexterm> and <command>hard disks</command><indexterm><primary>hard disks</primary></indexterm>. An operating system may start <command>paging</command><indexterm><primary>paging</primary></indexterm> and can use parts of the hard disk as memory storage.</para>
	<para>A <command>process</command><indexterm><primary>process</primary></indexterm> is compiled source code that is currently running on the computer. Only one process at a time can run on a <command>CPU</command><indexterm><primary>CPU</primary></indexterm> or processor. The operating system will provide <command>multitasking</command><indexterm><primary>multitasking</primary></indexterm> features by giving every process a small amount of time (about 50ms max) to run on the CPU, before interrupting it, and giving control to the next process. For us humans, applications seem to run at the same time. When more than one CPU is present in the system, the operating system can support <command>multiprocessing</command><indexterm><primary>multiprocessing</primary></indexterm>. This really enables applications to run simultaneously.</para>
	<para>Applications receive a vast amount of <command>virtual address space</command><indexterm><primary>virtual address space</primary></indexterm> from the operating system, so they don't interfere with other applications.</para>

<section><title>Where to find help ?</title>
	<section><title>Manual Pages</title>
		<para>Most Unix tools and commands have pretty good man pages. Type <command>man</command><indexterm><primary>man</primary></indexterm> followed by a command (for which you want help) and start reading. Ah, and press <command>q</command> to quit the manpage.</para>
		<screen>
paul@laika:~$ man whois
Reformatting whois(1), please wait...
paul@laika:~$ 
		</screen>
		<para>Manpages can be useful when you are switching a lot between different flavors of unix, to find those little differences in commands. Very often manpages also describe configuration files and daemons.</para>
		<screen>
paul@laika:~$ man syslog.conf
Reformatting syslog.conf(5), please wait...
paul@laika:~$ man syslogd
Reformatting syslogd(8), please wait...
		</screen>
		<para>The <command>man -k</command><indexterm><primary>man -k</primary></indexterm> command (same as <command>apropos</command><indexterm><primary>apropos</primary></indexterm>) will show you a list of manpages containing your searchstring.</para>
		<screen>
paul@laika:~$ man -k syslog
lm-syslog-setup (8)  - configure laptop mode to switch syslog.conf ...
logger (1)           - a shell command interface to the syslog(3) ...
syslog-facility (8)  - Setup and remove LOCALx facility for sysklogd
syslog.conf (5)      - syslogd(8) configuration file
syslogd (8)          - Linux system logging utilities.
syslogd-listfiles (8) - list system logfiles
paul@laika:~$
		</screen>
		<para>By now you will have noticed the numbers between the round brackets. <command>man man</command><indexterm><primary>man man</primary></indexterm> will explain to you that these are section numbers. If you want to know more, RTFM (Read The Fantastic Manual). <emphasis>Unfortunately, manual pages do not have the answer to everyhting...</emphasis></para>

paul@laika:~$ man woman
No manual entry for woman

	<section><title>Red Hat Manuals online</title>
		<para>Red Hat has a lot of info online at http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/ in both pdf and html format. <emphasis>Unfortunately, the information there is not always up to date.</emphasis></para>

	<section><title>Searching the internet with Google</title>
		<para>Google is a powerful tool to find help about Unix, or anything else. Here are some tricks.</para>
		<para>Look for phrases instead of single words.</para>
		<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/phrase.jpg" format="EPS" align="center"></imagedata></imageobject></mediaobject>			
		<para>Search only pages from Belgium (or substitute .be for any other Top Level Domain).</para>
		<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/sitehint.jpg" format="EPS" align="center"></imagedata></imageobject></mediaobject>
		<para>Search for pages inside one domain</para>
		<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/sitehint2.jpg" format="EPS" align="center"></imagedata></imageobject></mediaobject>
		<para>Search for pages <command>not</command> containing some words.</para>
		<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/negativehint.jpg" format="EPS" align="center"></imagedata></imageobject></mediaobject>
	</section>
	<section><title>Wikipedia</title>
		<para>Wikipedia is a web-based, free-content encyclopedia. Its growth the past two years has been astonishing. You have a good chance of finding a clear explanation by typing your search term behind <command>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</command><indexterm><primary>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</primary></indexterm> like this example shows.</para>
		<mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/wikipedia.jpg" format="EPS" align="center"></imagedata></imageobject></mediaobject>

	<section><title>The Linux Documentation Project</title>
		<para>On <command>www.tldp.org</command><indexterm><primary>http://www.tldp.org</primary></indexterm> you will find a lot of documentation, faqs, howtos and man pages about Linux and many other programs running on Linux.</para>

<section><title>Discovering the classroom</title>
	<para>It is time now to take a look at what we have in this classroom. Students should be able to log on to one or more (virtual) Linux computers and test connectivity to each other and to the internet.</para>
