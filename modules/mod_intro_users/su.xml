<section><title>Switch users with su</title>
	<para>The <command>su</command><indexterm><primary>su(1)</primary></indexterm> command allows a user to run a shell as another user. Running a shell as another user requires that you know the password of the other user, unless you are root. The root user can become any other user without knowing the user's password.</para>

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ su harry
Password: 
[harry@RHEL4b paul]$ su root
Password: 
[root@RHEL4b paul]# su serena
[serena@RHEL4b paul]$
	</screen>
	<para>By default, the su command keeps the same shell environment. To become another user and also get the target user's environment, issue the <command>su -</command><indexterm><primary>su(1)</primary></indexterm> command followed by the target username. </para>

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ su - harry
Password: 
[harry@RHEL4b ~]$
	</screen>
	<para>When no username is provided to su or su - then the command will assume root is the target.</para>

[harry@RHEL4b ~]$ su -
Password: 
[root@RHEL4b ~]#
