		<para>You can set the <command>sticky bit</command><indexterm><primary>sticky bit</primary></indexterm> on a directory to prevent users from removing files that they do not own as a user owner. The sticky bit is displayed at the same location as the x permission for others. The sticky bit is represented by a <command>t</command> (meaning x is also there) or a <command>T</command> (when there is no x for others).</para>

	<section><title>setGID bit on directory</title>
		<para>The <command>SetGID</command><indexterm><primary>SetGID</primary></indexterm> can be used on directories to make sure that all files inside the directory are group owned by the group owner of the directory. The SetGID bit is displayed at the same location as the x permission for group owner. The SetGID bit is represented by an <command>s</command> (meaning x is also there) or a <command>S</command> (when there is no x for the group owner). Like this example shows, even though root does not belong to the group proj55, the files created by root in /project55 will belong to proj55 when the SetGID is set.</para>
