<section><title>about sniffing</title>
	<para>A good network administrator should be able to use a sniffer like <command>wireshark</command> or <command>tcpdump</command> to troubleshoot network problems.</para>
	<para>A good student will often use a sniffer to learn about networking.</para>

	<section><title>installing wireshark</title>
		<para>This example shows how to install <command>wireshark</command> on <command>.deb</command> based distributions like Ubuntu and Debian.</para>
		<screen>aptitude install wireshark</screen>
		<para>On <command>.rpm</command> based distributions you can use <command>yum</command> to install wireshark.</para>
		<screen>yum install wireshark</screen>

	<section><title>selecting interface</title>
		<para>When you first fire up wireshark, you will need to select an interface to sniff. You will see a dialog box that looks similar to this. Choose the interface that you want to sniff.</para>

		<para>On some distributions only root is allowed to sniff the network. You might need to use <command>sudo wireshark</command>.</para>

	<section><title>start sniffing</title>
		<para>In this example here, we sniffed a ping between two computers. The top pane shows that wireshark recognizes the icmp protocol, and captured all the ping packets between the two computers.</para>

	<section><title>use filters</title>
		<para>You might get lost in too many packets. A quick solution to see only the packets that are of interest to you is to apply filters. When you type <command>arp</command> and click apply, you will only see <command>arp</command> packets displayed.</para>
		<para>You can combine two protocols with a logical <command>or</command> between them. The example below shows how to filter only <command>arp</command> and <command>bootp</command> (or dhcp) packets.</para>

<section><title>tcpdump</title>
	<para>Sniffing on the command line can be done with <command>tcpdump</command>. Here are some examples.</para>
	<para>Using the <command>tcpdump host $ip</command> command displays all traffic with one host (192.168.1.38 in this example).</para>
	<screen>
root@ubuntu910:~# tcpdump host 192.168.1.38
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes
</screen>
	<para>Capturing only ssh (tcp port 22) traffic can be done with <command>tcpdump tcp port $port</command>. This screenshot is cropped to 76 characters for readability in the pdf.</para>
	<screen>
root@deb503:~# tcpdump tcp port 22
