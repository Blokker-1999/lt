		<para>1. Display <command>A B    C</command> with two spaces between B and C.</para>
		<screen>echo "A B  C"</screen>
		<para>2. Complete the following command (do not use spaces) to display exactly the following output:</para>
		<screen>echo -e "4+4=8" ; echo -e "10+14=24"</screen>
		<screen>4+4     =8</screen>
		<screen>10+14   =24</screen>
		<para>The solution is to use tabs with \t.</para>
		<screen>echo -e "4+4\t=8" ; echo -e "10+14\t=24"</screen>
		<para>3. Use echo to display the following exactly:</para>
		<screen>""\\`;     "_+</screen>
		<screen>echo \"\"\\\\\`\;\ \ \ \ \"\_\+</screen>
		<para>4. Use one echo command to display three words on three lines.</para>
		<screen>echo -e "one \ntwo \nthree"</screen>
		<para>5. Execute <command>cd /var</command> and <command>ls</command> in an embedded shell.</para>
		<screen>$(cd /var ; ls)</screen>
		<para>6. Create the variable embvar in an embedded shell and echo it. Does the variable exist in your current shell now ?</para>
		<screen>$(embvar=emb;echo $embvar) ; echo $embvar (the last echo fails).</screen>
		<screen>$embvar does not exist in your current shell</screen>
		<para>7. Explain what "set -x" does. Can this be useful ?</para>
		<screen>I can be useful to display shell expansion for troubleshooting your command.</screen>
		<para>8. Given the following screenshot, add exactly four characters to that command line so that the total output is FirstMiddleLast.</para>
		<screen>
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ echo  First; echo  Middle; echo  Last
First
Middle
Last
[paul@RHEL4b ~]$
		</screen>
		<screen>echo -n First; echo -n Middle; echo Last</screen>
