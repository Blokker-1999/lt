<section><title>bash shell history</title>
	<para>The bash shell will remember the commands you type, so you can easily repeat previous commands. Some variables are defining this process: <command>$HISTFILE</command><indexterm><primary>$HISTFILE</primary></indexterm> points to the location of the history file, <command>$HISTSIZE</command><indexterm><primary>$HISTSIZE</primary></indexterm> will tell you how many commands will be remembered in your current shell session, <command>$HISTFILESIZE</command><indexterm><primary>$HISTFILESIZE</primary></indexterm> is the truncate limit for the number of commands in the history file. Your shell session history is written to the file when exiting the shell.</para>

[paul@RHELv4u3 ~]$ echo $HISTFILE
/home/paul/.bash_history
[paul@RHELv4u3 ~]$ echo $HISTFILESIZE
1000
[paul@RHELv4u3 ~]$ echo $HISTSIZE
1000
[paul@RHELv4u3 ~]$

	<para>To repeat the last command, type <command>!!</command><indexterm><primary>!!</primary></indexterm>. This is pronounced as <command>bash bash</command>. To repeat older commands, use <command>history</command><indexterm><primary>history</primary></indexterm> to display your history and type <command>!</command><indexterm><primary>!</primary></indexterm> followed by a number. The shell will echo the command and execute it.</para>

[paul@RHELv4u3 ~]$ history
2  cat /etc/redhat-release 
3  uname -r
4  rpm -qa | grep ^parted
...
[paul@RHELv4u3 ~]$ !3
uname -r
2.6.9-34.EL
[paul@RHELv4u3 ~]$

	<para>You can also use the bash with one or more characters, the shell will then repeat the last command that started with those characters. But this can be very very dangerous, you have to be sure about the last command in your current shell history that starts with those characters! You can also use a colon followed by a regular expression to manipulate the previous command.</para>

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ ls file4

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ !ls
ls file4

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ !ls:s/4/5
ls file5

[paul@RHEL4b ~]$ history 4

  423  ls file4
  424  ls file5
