		<para>Redirecting <command>stderr</command> is done with <command>2&#062;</command><indexterm><primary>2&#062;</primary></indexterm>. This can be very useful to prevent error messages from cluttering your screen. The screenshot below shows redirection of <command>stdout</command> to a file, and <command>stderr</command> to <command>/dev/null</command><indexterm><primary>/dev/null</primary></indexterm>. Writing <command>1&#062;</command><indexterm><primary>1&#062;</primary></indexterm> is the same as &#062;.</para>

		<para>Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example, the command</para>
		<screen>ls > dirlist 2>&amp;1</screen>
		<para>directs both standard output (file descriptor 1) and standard error (file descriptor 2) to the file dirlist, while the command</para>
		<screen>ls 2>&amp;1 > dirlist</screen>
		<para>directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the standard error was made a copy of the standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist. </para>

	<section><title>swapping stdout and stderr</title>
		<para>When filtering an output stream, e.g. through a regular pipe ( | ) you only can filter <command>stdout</command>. Say you want to filter out some unimportant error, out of the <command>stderr</command> stream. This cannot be done directly, and you need to 'swap'  <command>stdout</command> and <command>stderr</command>. This can be done by using a 4th stream referred to with number 3:</para>
		<screen>3&#062;&#038;1 1&#062;&#038;2 2&#062;&#038;3</screen>
		<para>This Tower Of Hanoi like construction uses a temporary stream 3, to be able to swap <command>stdout</command> (1) and <command>stderr</command> (2). The following is an example of how to filter out all lines in the <command>stderr</command> stream, containing $uninterestingerror.</para>
		<screen>/usr/bin/$somecommand 3&#062;&#038;1 1&#062;&#038;2 2&#062;&#038;3 | grep -v $uninterestingerror  3&#062;&#038;1 1&#062;&#038;2 2&#062;&#038;3</screen>
		<para>But in this example, it can be done in a much shorter way, by using a pipe on STDERR:</para>
		<screen>/usr/bin/$somecommand |&#038; grep -v $uninterestingerror  </screen>
