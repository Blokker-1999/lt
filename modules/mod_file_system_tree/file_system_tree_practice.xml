	<para>1. Does the file /bin/cat exist ? What about /bin/dd and /bin/echo. What is the type of these files ?</para>
	<para>2. What is the size of the Linux kernel file(s) (vmlinu*) in /boot ?</para>
	<para>3. Create a directory ~/test. Then issue the following commands:</para>
	<screen>cd ~/test</screen>
	<screen>dd if=/dev/zero of=zeroes.txt count=1 bs=100</screen>
	<screen>od zeroes.txt</screen>
	<para>dd will copy one times (count=1) a block of size 100 bytes (bs=100) from the file /dev/zero to ~/test/zeroes.txt. Can you describe the functionality of /dev/zero ?</para>
	<para>4. Now issue the following command:</para>
	<screen>dd if=/dev/random of=random.txt count=1 bs=100 ; od random.txt</screen>
	<para>dd will copy one times (count=1) a block of size 100 bytes (bs=100) from the file /dev/random to ~/test/random.txt. Can you describe the functionality of /dev/random ?</para>
	<para>5. Issue the following two commands, and look at the first character of each output line.</para>
	<screen>ls -l /dev/sd* /dev/hd*</screen>
	<screen>ls -l /dev/tty* /dev/input/mou*</screen>
	<para>The first ls will show block(b) devices, the second ls shows character(c) devices. Can you tell the difference between block and character devices ?</para>
	<para>6. Use cat to display /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf. What is your idea about the purpose of these files ?</para>
	<para>7. Are there any files in /etc/skel/ ? Check also for hidden files.</para>
	<para>8. Display /proc/cpuinfo. On what architecture is your Linux running ?</para>
	<para>9. Display /proc/interrupts. What is the size of this file ? Where is this file stored ?</para>
	<para>10. Can you enter the /root directory ? Are there (hidden) files ?</para>
	<para>11. Are ifconfig, fdisk, parted, shutdown and grub-install present in /sbin ? Why are these binaries in /sbin and not in /bin ?</para>
	<para>12. Is /var/log a file or a directory ? What about /var/spool ?</para>
	<para>13. Open two command prompts (Ctrl-Shift-T in gnome-terminal) or terminals (Ctrl-Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-F2, ...) and issue the <command>who am i</command> in both. Then try to echo a word from one terminal to the other.</para>
	<para>14. Read the man page of <command>random</command> and explain the difference between <command>/dev/random</command> and <command>/dev/urandom</command><indexterm><primary>/dev/urandom</primary></indexterm>.</para>
