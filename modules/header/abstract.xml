	<para>This book is meant to be used in an instructor-led training. For self-study, the idea is to read this book next to a working Linux computer so you can immediately do every subject, even every command.</para>
	<para>This book is aimed towards novice Linux system administrators (and might be interesting and useful for home users that want to know a bit more about their Linux system). However, this book is not meant as an introduction to Linux desktop applications like text editors, browsers, mail clients, multimedia or office applications.</para>
