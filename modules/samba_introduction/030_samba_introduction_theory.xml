	<para>Samba is installed by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. If Samba is not yet installed, then you can use the graphical menu (Applications -- System Settings -- Add/Remove Applications) and select "Windows File Server" in the Server section.

<section><title>the SMB protocol</title>
	<section><title>brief history</title>
		<para>Development of this protocol was started by <command>IBM</command><indexterm><primary>IBM</primary></indexterm> in the early eighties. By the end of the eighties, most develpment was done by <command>Microsoft</command>. SMB is an application level protocol designed to run on top of NetBIOS/NetBEUI, but can also be run on top of tcp/ip.</para>
		<para>In 1996 Microsoft was asked to document the protocol. They submitted CIFS (Common Internet File System) as an internet draft, but it never got final rfc status.</para>
		<para>In 2004 the European Union decided Microsoft should document the protocol to enable other developers to write compatible software. December 20th 2007 Microsoft came to an agreement. The Samba team now has access to SMB/CIFS, Windows for Workgroups and Active Directory documentation.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>broadcasting protocol</title>
		<para>SMB<indexterm><primary>SMB</primary></indexterm> uses the NetBIOS <command>service location protocol</command>, which is a broadcasting protocol. This means that NetBIOS names have to be unique on the network (even when you have different IP-addresses). Having duplicate names on an SMB network can seriously harm communications.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>NetBIOS names</title>
		<para>NetBIOS<indexterm><primary>NetBIOS names</primary></indexterm> names are similar to <command>hostnames</command><indexterm><primary>hostname</primary></indexterm>, but are always uppercase and only 15 characters in length. Microsoft Windows computers and Samba servers will broadcast this name on the network.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>network bandwidth</title>
		<para>Having many broadcasting SMB/CIFS<indexterm><primary>CIFS</primary></indexterm> computers on your network can cause bandwidth issues. A solution can be the use of a <command>NetBIOS name server</command> (NBNS) like <command>WINS</command> (Windows Internet Naming Service).</para>
