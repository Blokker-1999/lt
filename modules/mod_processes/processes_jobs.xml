		<para>Some processes can be frozen with the <command>Ctrl-Z</command><indexterm><primary>Ctrl-Z</primary></indexterm> key combination. This sends a SIGSTOP to the process. When doing this in vi, the vi goes to the background, and can be seen with the <command>jobs</command><indexterm><primary>jobs</primary></indexterm> command. Processes started with an ampersand (&#038;) at the end of the command line can also be seen with <command>jobs</command>.</para>
