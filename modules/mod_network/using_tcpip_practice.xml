	<para>1. Use <command>ifconfig</command> to list all your network interfaces and their ip-addresses. Write down your ip-address and subnet mask.</para>
	<para>2. Use the GUI tool of your distro to set a fix ip address (use the same address as the one you got from dhcp). Verify with <command>ifconfig</command> and <command>ping</command> to a neighbour that it works. Also look at the configuration files in <command>/etc/network</command> or <command>/etc/sysconfig</command> to see how the GUI tool sets a fixed address.</para>
	<para>3. Use the GUI tool to enable dhcp again (and verify the changes in the config files).</para>
	<para>4. Use <command>ifdown</command> or <command>ifconfig</command> to disable and enable a network card. Verify the results with <command>ifconfig</command>.</para>
	<para>5. Is the <command>dhclient</command> daemon running ?</para>
	<para>6. Verify that you have a default gateway with two commands.</para>
	<para>7. Ping the default gateway, then look at the <command>mac-address</command> of the default gateway.</para>
