	<para>1. Use ifconfig to list all your network interfaces and their ip-addresses. Write down your ip-address and subnet mask.</para>
	<para>2. Use the GUI tool of your distro to set a fix ip address (use the same address as the one you got from dhcp). Verify with ifconfig and ping to a neighbour that it works. Also look at the configuration files in /etc/network or /etc/sysconfig to see how the GUI tool sets a fixed address.</para>
	<para>3. Use the GUI tool to enable dhcp again (and verify the changes in the config files).</para>
