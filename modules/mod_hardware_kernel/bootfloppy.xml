<section><title>Rescue boot floppy</title>
	<para>Modifying the boot process of your system may render it unbootable. So before we start playing with the kernel, let's make sure we have a backup boot method. One way to boot an unbootable system is by using the official Red Hat Enterprise Linux CD 1. At the boot prompt of this CD, type <command>linux rescue</command>, and an attempt will be made to rescue your system. Another way is to create a bootable floppy for your system with the <command>mkbootdisk</command><indexterm><primary>mkbootdisk</primary></indexterm> or <command>mkboot</command><indexterm><primary>mkboot</primary></indexterm> command. That is, if you still can, since most kernels are too big to fit on a 1.44M floppy these days.</para>
