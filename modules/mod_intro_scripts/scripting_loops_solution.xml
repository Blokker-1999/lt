<section><title>solution : scripting tests and loops</title>
	<para>1. Write a script that counts from 3 to 7 and then from 7 to 3, and all this three times, once with a for loop, once with a while loop and once with a until loop. Show the teacher that it works!</para>
	<para>2. Write a script that counts the number of files ending in .txt in the current directory.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

let i=0
for file in *.txt
do
	let i++
done
echo "There are $i files ending in .txt"
	</screen>
	<para>3. Wrap an if statement around the script so it is also correct when there are zero files ending in .txt.</para>
	<screen>#!/bin/bash

ls *.txt > /dev/null 2>&#038;1
if [ $? -ne 0 ] 
then echo "There are 0 files ending in .txt"
else
	let i=0
	for file in *.txt
	do
		let i++
	done
	echo "There are $i files ending in .txt"
fi
</screen>
