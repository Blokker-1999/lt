	<para>0. Give each script a different name, keep them for later!</para>
	<para>1. Write a script that receives four parameters, and outputs them in reverse order.</para>
	<para>2. Write a script that receives two parameters (two filenames) and outputs whether those files exist.</para>
	<para>3. Write a script that counts the number of files ending in .txt in the current directory.</para>
	<para>4. Write a script that asks for two numbers, and outputs the sum and product (as shown here).</para>
	<screen>
Enter a number: 5
Enter another number: 2

Sum:       5 + 2 = 7
Product:   5 x 2 = 10
	</screen>
	<para>5. Improve the previous script to test that the numbers are between 1 and 100, exit with an error if necessary.</para>
	<para>6. Improve the previous script to congratulate the user if the sum equals the product.</para>
	<para>7. Improve the script from question 2. to complain if it does not receive exactly two parameters.</para>
	<para>8. Write a script that counts from 3 to 7 and then from 7 to 3, and all this three times, once with a for loop, once with a while loop and once with a until loop. Show the teacher that it works!</para>
	<para>9. Write a script that asks for a filename. Verify existance of the file, then verify that you own the file, and whether it is writable. If not, then make it writable.</para>
	<para>10. Make a configuration file for the previous script. Put a logging switch in the config file, logging means writing detailed output of everything the script does to a log file in /tmp.</para>
	<para>11. Write a script with a case insensitive case statement, using the shopt nocasematch option. The nocasematch option is reset to the value it had before the scripts started.</para>
	<para>12. If time permits (or if you are waiting for other students to finish this practice), take a look at linux system scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d and try to understand them. Where does execution of a script start in /etc/init.d/samba ? There are also some hidden scripts in ~, we will discuss them later.</para>
