<section><title>man pages</title>
	<para>Most Unix files and commands have pretty good man pages to explain their use. Man pages also come in handy when you are using multiple flavors of Unix or several Linux distributions, since options and parameters sometimes vary.</para>
	<section><title>man $command</title>
		<para>Type <command>man</command><indexterm><primary>man</primary></indexterm> followed by a command (for which you want help) and start reading. Press <command>q</command> to quit the manpage. Some man pages contain examples (near the end).</para>

		<para>By now you will have noticed the numbers between the round brackets. <command>man man</command><indexterm><primary>man man</primary></indexterm> will explain to you that these are section numbers. Executable programs and shell commands reside in section one.</para>
		<screen>
1 Executable programs or shell commands
2 System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
3 Library calls (functions within program libraries)
4 Special files (usually found in /dev)

	<section><title>man $section $file</title>
		<para>So when refering to the man page of the passwd command, this is usually written as <command>passwd(1)</command>. Whereas the passwd file is explained in section five, thus the man page is referenced as <command>passwd(5)</command>. The screenshot explains how to open the man page in the correct section.</para>
		<screen>
[paul@RHEL52 ~]$ man passwd      # opens the lowest section (1)
[paul@RHEL52 ~]$ man 5 passwd    # opens a page from section 5
