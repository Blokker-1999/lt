NAMING CONVENTIONS
module: A module is a collection of docbook .xml files that reside in a module-directory.
module-directory: A module-directory is a sub directory of /modules who's name starts with mod_.
chapter: A chapter is defined by the <chapter></chapter> tag in docbook xml.
minibook: A collection of modules that belong tightly together. Can be built as a minibook.pdf file.
book: Either a minibook, or a collection of minibooks.


GOALS:
- obsolete the 'chapters' file (using a script that reads xml files in module-directories alphabetically)
- integrate the <part> tag into the docbook xml
- allow for smaller books (minibooks) that handle one topic
- build the larger (existing) books with these minibooks


ADDITIONAL GOALS:
- create a one-to-one relation between modules and chapters


HOW:
1. module-directories should have at least four files named:
010_$string_title
030_$string_theory
040_$string_practice
050_$string_solution

paul will rename all the xml files in the module-directories
serge can then write a script to parse a module-directory instead of the 'chapters' file

2. minibooks can be a single book in xml <book></book>

3. minibooks become parts in xml <part></part> when bundled in a book

paul will prepare the first minibook in 'experimental branch' so serge can test his script


EXTRA:
This system has the potential to add a 020_$string_about file in the mod_ directory. This xml file can serve as an introductory page to each chapter, and can also serve as a means for clients to customize the course (by chapter) based on the content of this introduction.
Paul really likes this idea because :
- it can reduce the book-toc to 1 line per chapter
- it can be used commercially to give "sales-people" a readable technical content to present to potential clients
- it would remove the (imho silly) toc per chapter
- it can be used while teaching to introduce the topic to students


CURRENT ACTIONS
- paul: create first minibook and notify serge when committed in experimental
- paul: continues with the other minibooks (and minichapters)
- serge: update the built project so it can parse module-directories without the chapters file


ISSUES
- some chapters are not split without extra work synchronizing practices with theory
- some chapters (like the introduction) are not easily split and require quite some rewriting
- (minor issue) pagebreaks are currently hardcoded in the xml files. Each xml file starts with a page brak, unless it immediately follows a chapter title
